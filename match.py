# A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. 
# This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript 
# (and many other languages), but it’s more similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell. 
# Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.
